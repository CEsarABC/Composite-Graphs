# Composite-Graphs
Composite Graphs Project, from local repository

****I wanted to have a json file I could modify at any given time, by adding info in it.
my first idea was to create a function to create a json file containing the info I wanted, without having to type every value
for every object and be able to add new values if I wanted. 
the creation of the json file was not a success, but I created an array of objects which is very similar to
the calls of json files in which the json file is an array filled with objects, so I decided to use this array as my data and it worked as having the jason file parsed and ready to work.

** it is great to be able to to create my own objects with arrays which a can change any time, even adding new arrays, which will become values for every object, as a new programmer this gives lots of ideas, like creating data bases with user inputs.

*I decided to use my array of objects to be the base of my graphs

* the concept and company came last to the development of the arrays, the first group was created with a group of women and later on the Disney store idea came as context to the graphs, the group of women was replaced by a mixed group of employees to which I added later on the job tittle.

*working with bootstrap, DC, D3, Crossfilter.

*I have a messy repository because is my first time trying to use github properly... sorry!!!

*this repository was created to host my the local repository in my computer, the problem is all my commits and info are in the same folder with my study files and its was late to be able to separate then and publish in git pages.

*https://cesarabc.github.io/gitProjectPage/index.html project visualization from a new repository made with just the files uploaded in order to use git pages.

all folders and files used as reference for the creation of the project are part of this repository

/////////////////the main project is located in Wproject folder/////////////////

*all dc grahps are shown in the file compositeProject.html

*the JS file holding the java scripts is cleanGraphs.js

*all modules used in the document are stored locally in the folder jsModules

# UX

This one page project was developed base on the creation of a complex system to create a data base using arrays, the idea was to show in a single page the different ways to show the data in graphs for comparison. A fast and reliable tool to access basic information on salaries and employees.

the structure of the page is based on single page where tabs and modals are bringing the extra content.

**////This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features

    Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
    ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

# Testing

- my main objective was from the beggining to create my own automated data base which could present ramdom data.
- My firts idea was the creation of a function which could create a Json file from a group of arrays. the creation of a external file with the right formating, which managed to be impossible with my knowlegde.
- the second idea came after analizing the estructure of a parsed Json file in which the file takes the form of an array of objects to which I was sure it was possible to do.
- the challenge came first creating the array of objects in which loops and methods had to work perfectly to create my array of objects.
- the second challenge was to use this array of objects on the DC and D3 frameworks in which I decided to ommit the parsing of a json file and work directly with the new objects array.
- the main Js file is 
- once all graphics were working properly the visual desing of the page started by using bootstrap elements and media queries
- I created multiple test files for java testing and HTML testing git was used in Pycharm software as version control for all my changes.
- the project was divided into html, css, js, modules, folders and files in order to organise the project.

///////////////////
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
