# Composite-Graphs
Composite Graphs Project, from local repository

****I wanted to have a json file I could modify at any given time, by adding info in it.
my first idea was to create a function to create a json file containing the info I wanted, without having to type every value
for every object and be able to add new values if I wanted. 
the creation of the json file was not a success, but I created an array of objects which is very similar to
the calls of json files in which the json file is an array filled with objects, so I decided to use this array as my data and it worked as having the jason file parsed and ready to work.

** it is great to be able to to create my own objects with arrays which a can change any time, even adding new arrays, which will become values for every object, as a new programmer this gives lots of ideas, like creating data bases with user inputs.

*I decided to use my array of objects to be the base of my graphs

* the concept and company came last to the development of the arrays, the first group was created with a group of women and later on the Disney store idea came as context to the graphs, the group of women was replaced by a mixed group of employees to which I added later on the job tittle.

*working with bootstrap, DC, D3, Crossfilter.

*I have a messy repository because is my first time trying to use github properly... sorry!!!

*this repository was created to host my the local repository in my computer, the problem is all my commits and info are in the same folder with my study files and its was late to be able to separate then and publish in git pages.

*https://cesarabc.github.io/gitProjectPage/index.html project visualization from a new repository made with just the files uploaded in order to use git pages.

all folders and files used as reference for the creation of the project are part of this repository

/////////////////the main project is located in Wproject folder/////////////////

*all dc grahps are shown in the file compositeProject.html

*the JS file holding the java scripts is cleanGraphs.js

*all modules used in the document are stored locally in the folder jsModules
