# Composite-Graphs
Composite Graphs Project, from local repository

****I wanted to have a json file I could modify at any given time, by adding info in it.
my first idea was to create a function to create a json file containing the info I wanted, without having to type every value
for every object and be able to add new values if I wanted. 
the creation of the json file was not a success, but I created an array of objects which is very similar to
the calls of json files in which the json file is an array filled with objects, so I decided to use this array as my data and it worked as having the jason file parsed and ready to work.

** it is great to be able to to create my own objects with arrays which a can change any time, even adding new arrays, which will become values for every object, as a new programmer this gives lots of ideas, like creating data bases with user inputs.

*I decided to use my array of objects to be the base of my graphs

* the concept and company came last to the development of the arrays, the first group was created with a group of women and later on the Disney store idea came as context to the graphs, the group of women was replaced by a mixed group of employees to which I added later on the job tittle.

*working with bootstrap, DC, D3, Crossfilter.
